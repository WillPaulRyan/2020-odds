## Sources

2020 Odds is inspired by Episode 1 of my friend Matt's podcast, [The Syntact Project](http://www.syntactproject.com/). In it, the hosts discuss the merits of [Futarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futarchy), a thought-provoking form of government.

The project relies on [BetData](https://betdata.io/), an odds-making API.
